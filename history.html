        <h2>History</h2>

        <h4>The Beginning</h4>
        The band begun in late 1990 when lawyer Ross Hoffman befriended bartender Dave Matthews, encouraging him to record demos of the songs Matthews had written. 
        With these demos, the two looked outward to musicians who could help complete the sound, eventually getting local drummer Carter Beauford, 
        as well as jazz musician LeRoi Moore. In interview, Matthews recalls that he wasn't looking for a drummer or a saxophonist, he just enjoyed the 
        people and the music they made. He asked the two to play how they want over the demos, not worrying so much about fitting a particular vision.

        As they continued to play and experiment, they wished to fill in their limited instrumentals, adding Stefan Lessard as a bassist. In 1991, 
        they added waiter Peter Griesar as their first keyboardist, as well as violinist Boyd Tinsley (who did not become a full-time member until 1992).

        Together, they recorded their first in-studio demo in early 1991, playing their first public show that April. The band continued playing live events 
        at places like Flood Zone, Trax nightclub, Muse Music Club, and some fraternities. Their first official release, Remember Two Things, came November 9, 1993 
        on the Bama Rags label (re-released by RCA in 1997). This album debuted as the highest independent entry on college charts, being certified platinum by the 
        RIAA in 2002.

        <h4>Rise to Fame</h4>
        DMB released its first live EP, Recently, in 1994, with their debut studio album, Under the Table and Dreaming, coming out September 27, 1994. 
        Some notable hits on this album include What Would You Say, Satellite, and Ants Marching. This album was certified six times platinum, and is what 
        launched the band to global fame. With this, and their following Crash album (released April 30, 1996), the band received multiple Grammy nominations and 
        secured their first Grammy Award for their song So Much to Say.

        With new guests, Dave Matthews Band returns to the studio to compose their third studio album Before These Crowded Streets, released on April 28, 1998. 
        This album featured hits like Stay (Wasting Time), Crush, and Don't Drink the Water. The album was quick to success, selling over 900,000 albums in the 
        first week of its release.
